TODO:

5. Make everything singular 
6. List.Done == Convert to text block (flatten) so that future changes to data does not change completed lists.

Audit urls
    maximize urls per page to minimize chance of user getting psudo-lost

lists.
    mark as done href (color coded by status)
    lists by store (not just related bubble)
    all lists should target=_blank
    
/recent/
    Not sure if I want to go the whole .logging() route or not, could probably
    just cheat and give recent by object type

/base/urls.py is a monster, keep her that way. kthnx
